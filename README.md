Machine that produces cups of tea:
It makes a cup of tea (it does not add milk or sugar) from start to finish, unassisted (once properly set up).
The timings ar currently set up for Rooibos tea but can be easily adjusted to other brewing times. Pretty simply it does this
by using a servo motor to turn the heat on, using a temperature sensor to detect when the water has boiled, turning the heat off,
pumping the water into the mug with a small pump, dunking in the teabag with another servo, waiting for it to brew and finally 
removing the teabag.
